What is a fully automated housing unit?
A fully automated housing unit like the Maison Terranova, often referred to as a smart home is a residential 
property equipped with advanced technology and integrated systems that allow for the automation and control 
of various aspects of the home. These systems are designed to enhance convenience, comfort, security, energy 
efficiency, and overall quality of life for the occupants. Some common features of the Maison Terranova 
housing units include:
<br/>
<i>
Home Automation<br/>
Smart Lighting<br/>
Climate Control<br/>
Security and Surveillance<br/>
Energy Management<br/>
Entertainment and Audiovisual Systems<br/>
Voice Control<br/>
Automated Window Movement<br/>
Remote Access<br/>
Safety Systems<br/>
</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Can I customise the automation features to suit my preferences?</b><br/>
In addition to the standard automation features provided in all Maison Terranova units, Primestix offers buyers 
the option to request customised automation solutions tailored to their specific unit. This includes the 
integration of personalized automation devices such as automated water closets, bidets, and other potential 
home automation devices based on individual preferences and needs.
Centralised Control: Residents can control various aspects of their home, such as lighting, climate, security, 
and entertainment systems, from a single interface, such as a smartphone app or voice commands, making it 
easy to manage their living environment.
Refrigerators, ovens, and washing machines, can be controlled remotely and offer features like energy efficiency 
and remote diagnostics.
If you can think of it, we can automate it.<br/><br/>
<b>What happens if there is a technical issue or malfunction in the automation system?</b><br/>
Our dedicated team of skilled technicians are readily available to provide comprehensive technical support 
services whenever required.
Redundancy of a device (Voice prompt/Smartphone/Control panel/Distribution box):
At Primestix, the home automation system operates across four distinct yet interconnected levels. In the event 
that one of these levels experiences a temporary malfunction or becomes inaccessible, residents retain the ability 
to manually control their home using the relay switches conveniently located within the distribution box. These 
layers of redundancy ensure that even if voice prompts, the mobile app, or the wall-mounted control panel 
encounter issues, homeowners can still maintain control over their home environment.
<br/><br/>
<b>Are there any ongoing costs associated with the automation system?</b><br/>
Except for the cost of acquiring a Maison Terranova unit, which encompasses all essential amenities, including 
the home automation devices, there are no additional charges for the automation system. 
However, if a buyer/occupant seeks customized automation beyond the standard home automation features, 
any such additional requests, if agreed on, will be financially covered by the buyer/occupant of the unit.
<br/><br/>
<b>Can I integrate third-party smart devices with the home automation system?</b><br/>
Indeed, residents have the flexibility to incorporate third-party smart devices into the home automation system, 
provided the existing wiring infrastructure isn’t modified. Devices such as Robot Vacuum cleaners can be 
seamlessly integrated with the AI control system, enhancing efficiency and convenience for our residents. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Is the automation system energy-efficient and environmentally friendly?</b><br/>
Yes, the automation system is not only highly energy-efficient but also environmentally conscious, contributing 
to a sustainable and eco-friendly living environment.
What is the warranty period for the automation system, and what does it cover?
The warranty for the automated technical devices in the housing unit extends for a duration of ten (10) years, 
encompassing upgrades and device malfunctions. It&apos;s important to note that this warranty does not extend to 
instances of deliberate damage, theft, negligence, or situations that fall outside the scope of normal wear and 
tear.
Specify the battery type and the warranty period for both the solar panel and batteries.
Lithium batteries are often considered one of the best choices for solar inverters and solar energy storage 
systems for several reasons:
Lithium batteries have a high energy density, meaning they can store a significant amount of energy in a 
relatively small and lightweight package. This is particularly advantageous for solar inverters and residential 
solar energy systems, where space may be limited.
Long Cycle Life, Efficiency, Low Self-Discharge, Maintenance-Free, Scalability: Lithium battery systems can 
often be easily expanded by adding more battery modules to accommodate increased energy storage needs.
The lifespan of the batteries is 20 years, inverted is built to last 10 years, while the solar panel can last for an 
extended period of 25 years.
<br/><br/>
<b>Can I visit a model automated home to see the system in action before subscribing?</b><br/>
Yes, at Primestix, we highly recommend that prospective buyers visit our showrooms and offices to experience 
firsthand our model automated homes. We actively promote this practice and ensure that each of our building 
sites has a dedicated model space for convenient viewing. For an even more immersive experience, you are 
welcome to visit our office located at 19, Philip Shaibu Crescent, Wuye, Abuja.
